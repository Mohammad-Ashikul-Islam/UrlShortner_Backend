# URL Shortner API 


### Built with 

This URL Shortner Backend is built with [Node](https://nodejs.org/en), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) & [Short-Unique-Id](https://www.npmjs.com/package/short-unique-id)


## Working Methodology

- Schema Contains three property named longUrl, shortUrlCode, visitCount
- LongUrl used to keep the record of provided Long URL
- shortUrlcode is created in `create` request. shortUrlCode is unique generated by short-unique-id. It's ten length long
- shortUrlCode is appended to the last of generated short URL and acts as a unique identifier
- shortUrlCode can be used to get statistics in the name of longUrl, visitedCount and creation Date in `find/:shortcode/stat` request
- A new record created in `create` request with provided long Url & instantly generated shortUrlCode
- visitsCount keeps count record of total `redirection` to main URL from short URL for a record
- visitsCount increases by one while a new `redirection` occurs
